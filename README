Fast process startup for common lisp

Installation
============

1. `autoreconf -i`

2. `./configure`

3. `make`

4. `make install`

Usage
=====

1. Start the server: `cl-zygote`

2. Run the client: `clz -e "(print 'hello-world)"`

Theory of Operation
===================

1. The server `cl-zygote` is a lisp process that waits on a unix
   domain socket for connections from clients.

2. The client `clz` connects to the server and passes to an expression
   to evaluate along with its standard input, output, and error file
   descriptors.

3. The server then forks a child handler, dups the client's file
   descriptors to its own, and evaluates the passed expression.

Loosely inspired by the Android Zygote process.
